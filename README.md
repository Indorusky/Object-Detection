# Object-Detection
This project demonstrates real-time object detection using YOLOv8 and OpenCV in Python. It captures live video from a webcam, processes each frame with a deep learning model, and displays detected objects with bounding boxes and confidence scores. The setup is lightweight and easy to run on a standard laptop.
